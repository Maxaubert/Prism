/**
 * THE HELP PANEL'S CATALOGUE, its shape (#12).
 *
 * Owner, 2026-09-19: "make the shell more user friendly and the learning curve
 * less harsh: an easy to use panel where you can find shell commands", with
 * "metadata on each command so a natural-language search finds it ('how do I
 * find big files', not only the command's name)". And on 2026-09-20: "a pop up
 * with copy icons for easy copying, searchable, natural language".
 *
 * So an entry is written TASK FIRST: what someone wants to do, in the words
 * they would use, and only then the command that does it. The catalogue is
 * CURATED and ships with the app: it works offline, needs no model and no
 * network, and can be reviewed line by line. Nothing in it is ever run or typed
 * by the app (owner, 2026-09-19: picking a command does NOT insert it into the
 * shell). The panel shows, and copies on request.
 */

 *  every shell (git, the agents' own CLIs, npm). 'windows' is the same text in
 *  PowerShell and Command Prompt and does NOT work in Bash (winget, wsl.exe,
 *  where.exe): a WSL tab never shows it (owner, 2026-10-13: a Bash list made
 *  "mostly" of things that "dont work in wsl" teaches nobody Linux). */
